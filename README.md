# react-maps
 MapBox App

# Description 
The Raptor Maps Product Team talked to many solar maintenance companies and
crunched some numbers. It was determined that managers of solar maintenance
teams want the ability to know where all of their technicians are on a solar farm at
any given time on a web application. The manager is our primary user. This tool is
critical for safety and near-real time collaboration. In order to accomplish this feature
we want to show each technician’s “live” location on a map interface.
